**WANTED:** Frontend Flutter Developer/UI Designer CoFounder (Possible CXO)

**WHO YOU ARE:** You must be deeply concerned about what is happening to the planet and to society and have a huge yearning to use your talents to make a huge difference, even if it means temporarily major reduction in your salary, to make what could be the most important social change tool of 2019 and 2020, arguably “the absolutely most critical time in our species history” (Carl Sagan)  before it will be too late according to most scientific estimates.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:**

  1. If funding delayed, then improve upon existing 10-min video demo viewable at (http://bit.ly/WinWiselyPrep) now in prottapp, and/or produce new one in sketch

  2. Improve on existing work flow diagrams

  3. Work with rest of tech team to ensure idiot-proof UI, doing additional user research and user testing

  4. Design and help conducting ongoing UI user testing during beta as we improve UI

**SKILLS WE ARE LOOKING FOR:**

- We need a person that has used Flutter and Dart ([https://flutter.dev/](https://flutter.dev/)) to help with building Flutter apps for Web, Desktop, and Mobile.

- Any Golang experience is useful also, such as Gomobile. We are mostly concerned with:
  - I18n
  - Search
  - Event driven architecture
  - Moor / Hive / Sqlite data storage ( [https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite))
  - Provider patterns ( BLOC, MVP)
  Google Desktop [https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding)

- Near senior or senior level experience doing mobile-friendly web app UI design. 

- Communicative (quickly responds to texts and emails) and transparent

- Nice-To-Have’s: Connections with funders or people who know wealthy people; connections with other needed talent (social media director, digital marketing director, etc)

**LOCATION:**

You can live/work from anywhere.

**HOURS:**

Co-Founder, PT/FT at least 20 hrs/wk

**COMPENSATION:**

Project Based and based on funding able to raise. We have enough at the moment to at least provide basic living expenses for at least the first 3-4 months, and are optimistic about raising much more in the next 4-8 wks. Our full-time Product Director cofounder has raised more than $1.5M in the past for progressive projects, and his prior Internet-based consumer startup has raised $350k and is beginning to take off.
