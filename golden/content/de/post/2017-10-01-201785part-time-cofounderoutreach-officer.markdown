### WHO WE ARE:

WinWisely.org is an open source nonprofit and free to activists mobile-friendly app that is being created to answer what our team considers the mother of all questions:

_How can progressive campaigns by next year be able to recruit, commit, and support/reward massively larger numbers of volunteers willing to do much bigger impact tasks to save the planet and democracy before it's too late?  _

To see our answer and find out more, first watch this [3 minute animation](http://bit.ly/crowdacting) on the concept of Crowdacting (albeit applied to a more conservative strategy), and after that, go to [WinWisely.org](http://winwisely.org) for our one-pager and reviews from over 20 top organizers and then ask to view our 10-minute demo.

Our aim is nothing less than to revolutionize organizing because history shows that organizing is our only option to achieve the above goal.

We'll be creating a one-stop shop mobile-friendly app, with a unique integration of three functionalities, the most innovative and powerful being crowdacting (see crowdacting.org). So we say WinWisely is "Kickstarter and more meets movement organizing." We also think we’ve got some creative ideas for getting the 2-6M potential big task activists out there to come to us and register.

### JOB DUTIES:

Negotiable. None are set in stone except duty #1, below. Flexibility is a must; you must be willing to wear at least 2 or 3 hats, since this is a startup. However, we can adjust this list based on your preferences and ideas.

1. (First month or so:) Finding contact information for potential funders and members of our Board of Advisers, and making follow-up calls to our emails. You will not be expected to pitch.

2. Help identify and then become a liaison between our team and campaigns (eg anti fossil fuel, medicare4All, TaxtheRich, reverse grotesque wealth inequality, etc) eager to get our help, to beta test our tools. Help these campaigns with their questions and offering support. The goal is to maximize both our effectiveness in helping these campaigns and their satisfaction with our tools, which includes identifying bottlenecks and anything else that is reducing our ability to send the campaigns lots of committed volunteers

3. researching topics ranging from activist cause marketing to privacy/security tactics to behavioral economics tactics for reducing flake out and increasing peer-peer bonding

4. occasional face to face user testing

5. scheduling calls via zoom or google with campaign organizers, tech help, potential donors, marketing gurus etc and taking good notes on such meetings (Zoom records; so you need not be a super-fast typist)

6. if you like networking, attending conferences and events to find us useful contacts

7. optional: until we bring on board a social media/marketing talent, updating our FB and twitter accounts

8. additional duties as they come up in response to needs of the beta test campaign organizers  
 

### **HOURS:**

You choose: PT ok, but the closer to full time, the better.

### **COMPENSATION:**

Very low to start until funding after short trial period.

We hope, however to raise sufficient funds by the end of March to be able to provide at least enough to cover people’s basic expenses and hopefully much more. All but one of our team are currently volunteers. Once we have achieved POC, you can expect a competitive salary.

Our chief cofounder has been a fundraiser most of his life (raised $1.5 for many of his docs, for Nader, election protection, for the Green Party, Dems running for US Senate, etc), and is optimistic about raising sufficient funding to provide livable income for all WinWisely cofounders (who will get paid before himself!) He has also been the chief cofounder of two prior social venture startups that have succeeded, one which recently raised $275k within past year and might soon be hugely successful, and eventually help fund WinWisely once it is sufficiently revenue positive.

### **LOCATION:**

You can be anywhere.

### **TO APPLY:**

1. study our WinWisely.org page and reviews (in the carousel there) from 20 top organizers (bit.ly/WinWiselyReviews)

2. view our demo packet (bit.ly/WinWiselyPrep)

3. Drop us a cover letter to Gary@WinWisely.org, with a resume and a statement of interest and reactions to the demo packet (preferably bulleted)

4. Then call Gary Krane at 650 383 8435 to make sure we've gotten it. We’ll try to get back to you within 48 hours. Weekends ok. Be sure to include in bullet points prior relevant accomplishments that might demonstrate your passion for saving the planet and/or democracy/ social and economic justice etc, and your financial considerations.
