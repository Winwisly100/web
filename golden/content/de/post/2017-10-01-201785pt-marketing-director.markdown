Develop and widely disseminate the first app capable of recruiting, committing, managing, and supporting the massively larger numbers of volunteers environmental, social justice, healthcare, BLM etc. groups urgently need to do much larger tasks than ever before. For example:

  * Shutting down a pipeline or LNG (fracked gas) terminal, which could require 10,000/week for 12 weeks plus supporting personnel) to succeed,

  * Passing state-level Green New Deal Jobs bill in PA or Colorado, requiring 10,000 canvassers and 15,000 phone bankers,

  * Passing a statewide fracking ban in PA or CO, requiring similar numbers

  * Passing Medicare for all bills in various states, requiring 1000s of canvassers, phone bankers, even direct action volunteers,

  * Instituting a paper-based hand counted election system,

  * Finding the millions necessary to engage in massive civil resistance for a successful viable General Strike (like the 1963 Women’s Strike for Peace on steroids) to create even greater changes.

### THE RESPONSIBILITIES:

2.  Perform outreach to influencers/others able to give us exposure

  * The chance to help dramatically increase the size and impact of the resistance.
