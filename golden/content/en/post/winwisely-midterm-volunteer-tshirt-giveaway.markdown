Want to put the cherry on top of that oh-so-good feeling of volunteering? Why not have that cherry be a brand new T-shirt! We are happy to say that Danny over at Blue Wave Botique has offered to support our cause the best way he can by donating 50 super soft and stylish T-shirts. Head over to [Blue Wave Botiqueâ€™s website](https://bluewave.boutique/) to check out some of the clever designs Danny has come up with. 

From now until the end of the 2018 midterm elections we will be giving away a T-shirt to anyone who meets the following criteria:

  1. You must like the GetCourageNow Facebook Page.

  2. You must download the GetCourageNow app.

  3. You must volunteer to any of the campaigns or causes we currently have on our app.

If you have met all these criteria we will send you an email with instructions to redeem your t-shirt.

Limitations: Must be 18 years or older, must be a US Citizen, one entry per person, void where prohibited.
