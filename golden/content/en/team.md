### **Gary Krane, PhD** and how the WinWisely idea came about:

Gary is the co-founder of WinWisely. He came up with the first part of the idea more than three years ago while was watching Bill McKibben (founder of 350.org) , Michael Brune (ED of Sierra Club) and actor, Daryl Hannah get arrested at the White House protesting the XL pipeline. He thought, "*I wish I had been there. So, where is the next opportunity to do direct action to stop this horrific pipeline?*"

He started searching online to find the next action he could join.  Ninety frustrating and unproductive minutes later he thought “we need an easy one-stop-shop where people can quickly find a campaign about what angers them most, get the most important details about that campaign, and give them the choice of how they can best help.”

He came up with the kickstarter applied to organizing or “crowdacting” idea shortly after talking to one of the top people at the SierraClub, national office, in SF, who when asked, "What's it going to take to stop this catastrophic trajectory?, " the Sierra Club exec responded, "With the forces arrayed against us in the oil industry and extrapolating from the Civil Rights movement, the anti Viet Nam war movement and other movements, probably nothing less than one million people willing to risk arrest to stop the construction of these pipelines, and at least double that willing to do conventional organizing."  To recruit those kinds of numbers, and as an experienced organizer and also PhD psychologist, he realized that "fear of wasting my time if we lose," was one of the key barriers and that a "Kickstarter" solution could possibly address: 

Drawing on his PhD training in psychology and his user testing work as the lead co-founder and CEO of [CoupleWise.com](https://www.couplewise.com/), he confirmed that the key barrier organizations face in recruiting much larger numbers is the fear most potential volunteers have of losing—that their commitment of time and energy (and/or getting arrested) will be for naught.  This lead to the epiphany that the concept behind Kickstarter could be applied to action, not just money! A crowdfunding-type platform like Kickstarter could be used to recruit all kinds of action resources, from risking arrest doing nonviolent direct action, to joining a city or state or even nation wide strike as well as knocking on several hundred doors on a weekend to get a progressive elected, if the user was given the power to make a **_conditional commitment_**—to say, for example that they would be willing to join in this or that courageous action if and only X or y or Z numbers of others were willing to do the same

Gary is a lifelong activist, who has fought in many major battles from the farm-workers and civil rights struggles, to the anti Vietnam war and nuclear freeze movements, as well as a field organizer and strategist  on six presidential and three US Senate campaigns, and even on Alexandra Octavio Cortez’s Congressional race in Queens, NY.  He’s been arrested for direct action himself  numerous times, and worked seven months as a field organizer for the Bernie Sanders campaign in three states including Texas. He was one of the key anti-nuke documentary filmmakers of the 80s, and was the First Place Winner in the American Film Festival in 1984 and the National Film and Video Festival in 1989 with two PBS anti-nuke specials. He has been focused fulltime on WinWisely for most of the past 3 years. 

His prior startup, CoupleWise.com (he was the founding CEO) also tackling one of the biggest problems in the world, how to make committed relationships succeed, is starting to take off, though will not be money making enough to support WinWisely till late 2020. CoupleWise won two International and 3 national awards as a social venture startup. [Here is his detailed resume.](https://bit.ly/GaryKraneResume)
