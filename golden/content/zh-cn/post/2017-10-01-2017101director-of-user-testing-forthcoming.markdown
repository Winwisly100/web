### **WHO WE ARE: **

[WinWisely.org](http://winwisely.org/) is an open source non profit and free to activists mobile-friendly app that was created to answer the mother of all questions**_: How can progressive organizations and electoral campaigns in the next few months recruit, commit, and support/reward massively larger numbers of volunteers willing to do much bigger impact tasks to save the planet and democracy before it's too late for both?_**

To understand our answer first view [the 3 minute "Crowdacting" animation](https://bit.ly/crowdacting), and after that, go to [WinWisely.org](http://winwisely.org/), to read our one-pager and reviews from 14 top organizers from across the nation, and then request a 7 minute demo (give us at least a 2 day warning and a couple day/time choices).

### **SUMMARY**:

We'll be creating a one-stop shop mobile-friendly app, with a unique integration of three functionalities, the most innovative and powerful being crowdacting (see the animation.) **_So we say WinWisely is "Kickstarter and more meets movement organizing." _**Our aim is nothing less than to revolutionize organizing because it is our only option to save democracy and the planet before it is too late.

### **JOB DUTIES: Flexibility a must**

  1. **Finding and executing one on one user testing for at least 20-30 individual representing the 3-4 major age demographics and married/not married**

  2. **From the above deducing best questions to ask and best possible answers to use for multiple choice survey**

  3. **Find most cost-effective methods to do survey(s) to get at least 500 respondents hence reach at least 25,000 readers.**

  4. **Analyze and clearly present the results**

  5. **Repeat similar process for determining most effective incentives to use to a)get users to register and b) keep them engaged**

  6. **Additional duties as they come up**

### **HOURS: you choose, but closer to fulltime, the better**

### **COMPENSATION: **

Very low to start until funding. If you are in NYC, it might include a free private apartment in the village! Our chief cofounder has been a fundraiser most of his life and is optimistic about raising sufficient funding to provide livable income within 2-3 months. He has also been the chief cofounder of a prior social venture startup that has successfully launched and on the verge of taking off. We hear in December about a $70k grant which would immediately raise salaries to $2000-2500/mo, but know many potential high donors to raise at least $150k more.

### **LOCATION: YOU can be anywhere. We are based in NYC, our designer is in Seattle, and another of our original cofounders is in SF.**

### **TO APPLY:**

  1. Study the 3 min Crowdacting and our WinWisely splash page and reviews

  2. Read our premises at [WinWisely.org/premises](http://win wisely.org/premises)

  3. Drop us a cover letter to Gary@WinWisely.org, describing your deepest motivation(s), why us, and in bullet points any relevant experience or training and/or mentor/advisers who could be helpful to you, and attach a resume and then call Gary Krane at (650) 383 8435 to make sure weâ€™ve gotten it. We'll try to get back to you within 48 hours.
