**(20 hrs minimal/wk to start)**

**to put grassroots non-violent direct action (NVDA) and strike organizing on steroids using a new **

**out-of-the-box mobile-friendly secure open source one-stop web-based app **

**LOCATION:** You can be based anywhere.   
**PART TIME OK **if can start immediately (but ideally at least 15 hrs/wk)

**WHO WE ARE--OUR MISSION:**

[**WinWisely.org**](http://WinWisely.org)** is our splash page, that has our one pager and reviews from 20 top organizers and activist IT pros nationwide.**

Our Mission is to provide a major one stop mobile-friendly one stop app breakthrough solution to what we call the two-sided "mother of all challenges,” the holy grail for grassroots organizers:

_"How can the progressive grassroots organizations of today_**_ recruit, commit, support and cleverly organize massively larger numbers of volunteers than we can right now, to do much bigger impact tasks than we are now doing, and ASAP--before it is too late to save democracy _**_and _**_mother nature _**_as we know it. And conversely, how can the 3-6M still untapped potential activists out there yearning for major _**_change quickly find the right campaign to join_**_, and the right role that fits their skills and preferences._

**JOB DUTIES:**

  1. **If funding delayed, then improve upon existing 11min video demo (viewable at **[**bit.ly/WinWiselyPrep**](http://bit.ly/WinWiselyPrep)**) now in prottapp, and/or produce new one in sketch**

  2. ** Improve on existing work flow diagrams**

  3. **Work with rest of tech team to ensure idiot-proof UI, doing additional user research and user testing**

  4. **Design and help conducting ongoing UI user testing during beta as we improve UI**

**Who We Are:**

After viewing our clickable 3min animation and 10-minute rough video demo, more than [20 top organizers and IT activists](https://bit.ly/WinWiselyReviews) have been impressed with our potential to put organizing on steroids. And their suggestions for improvement have continually been integrated into its ongoing design.

**Thumbnail on What We Creating:  See bit.ly/WinWiselyPrep for 3min animation, endorsements, and clickable video demo, the demo that needs revising**

Drawing from latest research in behavioral economics and evidence based organizing**, **WinWisely is based on a unique integration of four functionalities, one of which is called** ****_crowdacting_** (not crowdfunding). So **_think: "Kickstarter + Peer Bonding and Behavioral economics meets movement organizing."_** We’ll be open source & free to most nonprofits and expect to play a major role to enable XRebellion, Fridays for Future, Sunrise Movement, ChildrensStrikefortheEnvironment etal to recruit the vast numbers they need to take on the necessary resister and striker roles in order to succeed.

**Qualifications:**

  1. We need a person that has used flutter and dart ([https://flutter.dev/](https://flutter.dev/)) to help with building Flutter apps for Web, Desktop and Mobile.

Any golang experience is useful also, such as gomobile.

We are mostly concerned with:

    * I18n

    * Search

    * Event driven architecture

    * Moor / Hive / Sqlite data storage ( [https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite))

    * Provider patterns ( BLOC, MVP)

Google Desktop ( [https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding))

  2. Near senior or senior level experience doing mobile-friendly web- app UI design. 

  3. Communicative (quickly responds to texts and emails) and transparent

  4. NiceToHave’s: connections with funders or people who know wealthy people; connections with other needed talent (social media director, digital marketing director, etc)

  5. Able to start immediately

**Compensation**

Negotiable, depending on experience, our level of funding, and if able to bring in other talent (eg a social media / crowdfunder or outreach director or fundraiser associate). We have enough at the moment to provide VLE (voluntary basic living expenses), but are optimistic we will raise enough soon to cover at least 50% market rate and maybe much more. We now have the staff to spend 40hrs+/wk fundraising, and a big advantage having just been asked by a key chapter of Extinction Rebellion to beta test with them

To be clear, we seek people far more motivated by justice and saving mother earth, than by money. If the betatest is successful, then much larger funding will come (donors tell us) meaning much larger salaries by this summer.

**TO APPLY**: (see next page)

  1. First check out[ this 3min animation,](http://bit.ly/crowdacting) while imagining “crowdacting” being used instead by XR to recruit NVDA volunteers or used by FridaysForFuture for recruiting milliions of student, teacher, and parent climate strikers

  2. Then read [our one pager](https://bit.ly/WWPitchLinks) (which includes link to the current 10min videodemo needing updating) and [some of the reviews from top organizers](https://WinWiselyReviews) and IT activists and confirm you’ve done so in your cover letter

  3. IMPORTANT: SEND us a cover letter to [Gary@WinWisely.org](mailto:Gary@WinWisely.org), describing

    * “Why us” (when there are so many other do good outfits out there?) and 

    * listing (bullets) relevant skills and/or activist type accomplishments, as well as sample apps.  Be sure to include your phone contact info and city and time zone, in your sig 

**Be sure subject line states UI Designer/ Cofounder/your city and [how you heard of us]**
