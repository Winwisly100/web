"In the battle between the forces of good and evil, greed and compassion, democracy and plutocracy, there is only one thing that has consistently made the difference: organizing."  —Kurt Vonnegut

As Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan demonstrate in their book, Why Mass Resistance Works (based on the study of 60 mass resistance struggles from 1900 to the Ukrainian Revolution in 2004-5), once you have 3.5% of the public actively engaged in mass non-violent civil resistance, you have better than an 80% chance of toppling a right wing authoritarian government. The urgent and critically important changes we need to make today are far less challenging than totally replacing the existing government, and therefore would require far fewer people, though far more than current organizing technology has been able to recruit, commit, and support. 

**The mother of all challenges we must therefore confront and solve is this:**

**How can the grassroots organizations of today and tomorrow recruit, commit, support, and cleverly organize massively greater numbers of volunteers than we are currently able to engage, to do much bigger impact tasks than we are currently doing, and ASAP—before it is too late to save Democracy and Mother Nature as we know them.**

The numbers are there:  Several million Americans are now sufficiently angry and/or fearful and yearning to do more than sign petitions, go to protests, or make calls, since they see these often don’t work. With every outrageous Trump action, these numbers of potential activists only increase.  As the number of people who canvassed, phone banked, and held events for the Bernie and Hillary campaigns, in addition to the masses who participated in the Women’s March in January, 2017 proved, there are large enough numbers out there who are willing to undertake major conventional organizing tasks if given an exciting vision/goal and winnable path that would constitute a huge, positive change. In regards to direct action tactics: Approximately 120,000 people signed up years ago to a little-known website called the “Pledge of Resistance” and stated they would be willing to risk arrest to stop the Keystone Pipeline. We believe the numbers would be much larger now, given the worsening situation of the planet. WinWisely will make it much easier and faster for those inclined to commit and stay committed.

We need a one-stop shop that makes it easy for anyone seeking a progressive solution to find the campaign and action or role that best fits their capacities, skills, limitations and other preferences, and that enables them to sign up for a specific role, or at least let the campaign know what they would need to commit to that action (e.g. free child care, more confidence that the campaign would win if they got involved, an invitation from a friend, etc.). It is now far too difficult for potential activists to find a campaign addressing the issues important to them that also a) are close in proximity, b) possess an exciting goal or vision, c) have a clear plan for victory, d) contain enough variance in roles to meet the user’s preferences, and, most importantly, e) systematically enables the individual user to inform the campaign of the social supports he or she needs to commit.

We need a process to quickly mobilize people to immediately resist a future “Reichstag shock doctrine” power play by Trump, and any sudden attempt to eliminate Internet Freedom, suspend the Constitution, and declare martial law. This could happen at any moment: from the next climate disaster (which could be bigger than ever), another 9/11-allowed catastrophe, or a showdown with China or Iran purposely created, and ever more likely, the closer Trump gets to impeachment.

If you have seen our cofounder’s critically acclaimed PBS special, Losing Control ([bit.ly/LosingControlGaryKrane](http://bit.ly/LosingControlGaryKrane)), you know we are extremely close to blundering into an inadvertent nuclear war. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists now has the doomsday clock set to two minutes to midnight!

**Conclusion:** It is therefore urgent and critically important to create, thoroughly test, perfect and deploy WinWisely as soon as possible, especially in time to affect the upcoming mid-term elections, so that it will be ready to deploy in time for the upcoming battles of 2019, which will inevitably occur no matter what happens in November.
