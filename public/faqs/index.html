<h3 id="1-is-winwisely-for-causes-or-for-electoral-campaigns">1) Is Winwisely For Causes Or For Electoral Campaigns?</h3>

<p>If the latter, are there not already several apps (VAN being the most famous) that try to get people to turn out to vote? If for causes, what makes WinWisely so different from say Whatsapp, Facebook, instagram, text, and twitter?</p>

<h3 id="2-electoral-vs-cause-mass-civil-resistance-strategy-uses">2) Electoral vs Cause/Mass Civil Resistance Strategy Uses</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Though we believe WinWisely will be an immensely powerful new tool for winning elections (and we even coded an alpha for what such an app might like for taking back the US Senate in last year’s election, but too late and completely unfunded  to be of any use), this being 2019 and realizing winning elections, though a sine qua non, is entirely insufficient to address our emergency planetary crisis, we are primarily making an app to win cause campaigns, those relying on a mass civil resistance strategy in particular:</p></li>

<li><p>Specifically WinWisely aims to recruit and commit the huge numbers&ndash;millions&ndash; necessary who would be willing to go on strike to shut down a city or state if need be, and to do non-violent resistance to stop pipelines or construction of  gas power plants, as well as the usual 20+support tasks (almost all of whom are also necessary to win elections, from field organizing (canvassing) and texting friends,  to providing house party venues and supporter housing for serious out of town activists whose only need is housing, to data entry, social media and marketing help, to inviting speakers to a volunteer’s association or PTA, to of course donating (eg for licensed childcare). And so far, almost all the apps and websites we’ve heard of are strictly election campaign oriented, and are of no significant help to mass civil resistance recruitment.</p></li>

<li><p>The obsession with electoral focused apps is, in our view, tragic, if you know your American history (and worldwide major social change history in general, especially since 1900): The real lesson of American history is that it is the non electoral mass organizing campaigns, campaigns involving mass civil disobedience and strikes, that led to the greatest most consequential positive changes in our society. Read Howard Zinn’s Beyond Voting to get this fundamental point. Or for an updated version (his ends in the mid-70s), google my name (Gary Krane) and his.
But even for electoral organizing, WinWisely has clear advantages over existing latest tools: To clearly see this, see our  Competition matrix), which we hope looks at all the other major mobilizing apps from MobilizeAmerica to OutVote to NgpVan itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-but-isn-t-what-s-app-text-facebook-twitter-enough">3) But isn’t What’s App, Text, FaceBook, Twitter enough?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Though these tools can certainly initiate a ladder of engagement into any sort of grassroots campaign and are used to keep people informed and reminded, they are not tools specifically designed to address the various barriers unique to recruiting large numbers of people for courageous acts like NVDA and large ongoing strikes.At best they’ve only been able to be used for electoral tasks and one shot protests.</p></li>

<li><p>Furthermore, and most importantly: There are in fact no such tools to our knowledge that are designed to systematically recruit for mass civil resistance roles, not to mention that use a combination of four essentially free and proven motivator/engagement tools to solve the recruitment and commitment challenge. And we hypothesize that it will be in the cumulative and possible synergistic effect of these four functionalities seamlessly combined into one mobile friendly place  that we believe lies the recruitment and commitment power necessary to win.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the 4 underlying functionalities/innovations that through their synergy we believe will enable WinWisely to move mobilizing to the next level:</p>

<ol>
<li>CROWDACTING (kickstarter meets movement organizing) (see 3min animation in our Demo Packet)</li>
<li>Various concepts from Behavioral Economics (eg removal of barriers to commitment)</li>
<li>Stronger methods of creating Peer Bonds
4 . Wider (Expanded) Choice of Roles</li>
</ol>

<p>All have individually achieved POC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crowdacting was the key component to Groupon’s success</li>
<li>Peerbonding has been demonstrated by VoterCircle and Outvote</li>
<li>Tons of behavioral economics experiments have validated the power of “easifying” actions &ndash;removing barriers to commitment</li>
<li>Uprise has already demonstrated the effectiveness of offering “expanded role choice”</li>
</ul>

<p>CONCLUSION: However no apps to our knowledge combine all of these proven functionalities seamlessly into one onestop app.</p>
